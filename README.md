<b>Background</b>
<br>This is an educational project I build in my spare time during my train commutes to work. The goal was to build a single page application as well as a game using React.

The game part is simple memory game which involves finding pairs of emojis. The app can be found here... _link to be added here_

<b>Todo</b>
