Background
This is an educational project I build in my spare time during my train commutes to work. The goal was to build a single page application as well as a game using React. The single page asspect of the app is achieved through basic navigation of pages / /about /404

The game part is simple memory game which involves finding pairs of emojis. The app can be found here...
